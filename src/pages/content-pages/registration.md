We look forward to welcoming you, and together, we can make a meaningful impact in the world of housing and urbanism. We have established three levels of registration:

**Full Registration**\
Full registration fees contribute to covering a wide range of essential costs that go into making YIMBYtown 2024 a success, including the space for bringing so many people together, food and logistics, as well as speaker costs. We appreciate your support.

**Advocate Registration**\
We welcome nonprofit staff, volunteer advocates, academics, students, and others to register for YIMBYtown at the Advocate rate. This half-priced rate aims to make it accessible for individuals and organizations working with limited budgets who are eager to contribute to the vibrant discussions, workshops, and networking opportunities at YIMBYtown.

**Needs Based Complimentary Registration**\
We welcome those who care about building abundant housing and want to attend YIMBYtown – but for whom registration cost would be a barrier – to self-select for complimentary registration. This ensures that YIMBYtown remains an inclusive and welcoming platform where voices from all walks of life can come together to explore solutions and drive positive change in the housing landscape. We are immensely grateful to our sponsors for making this commitment to inclusivity possible.

**We are also offering travel scholarships and lodging assistance. The form to apply for travel and lodging assistance is expected to be available November 15th.**
