# Got an idea for a talk or panel at YIMBYtown 2024?

We’re inviting proposals for keynote speakers, panels, trainings, and opportunities to collaborate, laying the groundwork for housing abundance and sustainable cities.



## Keynotes 

Propose a talk



Speak to the entire YIMBYtown audience plus local Austinites.

We have limited space for keynotes, so we expect to allocate some proposed keynote speakers a panel spot instead, but please propose Keynote if you believe that a particular expert is likely to be relevant and exciting for nearly 1000 of us!  



Panel

Propose a speaker or topic



If you have a suggestion for a topic, speaker or a few speakers – including but not limited to yourself – please use this Panel form.  If you only have one speaker in mind and you’re not sure of what panel might make sense, tell us your idea and we will do our best to fit that speaker into a panel.



Training

If you or your organization has expertise related to abundant, affordable housing that you believe is useful for the YIMBYtown, tell us the details of the training you’d like to see, and the learning objectives for participants. 



Collaborative Workspace

We are making space at YIMBYtown 2024 for us to work together interactively to build our movement and actively collaborate on abundant housing strategies. For example, we are planning to have an interactive Team Meeting for anyone that wants to work on YIMBY reforms at the 2025 Texas legislative session that we think will also be useful for those interested in state policy change across the nation.



Please propose your ideas for Team Meetings that will guide discussions / collaborations on the real work that all of us are doing to make abundant housing available in all our communities. If you have ideas on who could lead the envisioning, planning, and facilitating this discussion, please add those people as “moderators” in your proposal. However, feel free to suggest an idea even if you’re not sure who might facilitate that discussion.
