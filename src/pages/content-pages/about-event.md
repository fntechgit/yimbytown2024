**About YIMBYtown**

YIMBYtown is the premier nationwide conference for pro-housing advocates, organizers, and policymakers. Over several days of trainings, panels, discussions, speeches, and networking, YIMBYtown provides vital space for the pro-housing movement to connect, learn, share, wrestle with difficult questions, and lay the groundwork for the next great burst of wins for abundant housing across the country. Previously hosted in Boulder, Colorado; Boston, Massachusetts; Oakland, California; and Portland, Oregon, YIMBYtown has engaged, empowered, and connected thousands of leading pro-housing activists from North America and beyond.

YIMBYtown 2024 will be held on the campus of UT-Austin on Monday & Tuesday, February 26 & 27, with potential auxiliary events on the 25th and 28th. AURA and Farm&City are the lead local partners, working closely with the Welcoming Neighbors Network to bring together the event and bring people from across the State of Texas and the nation.

**About the Host Organizations**

[AURA](http://www.aura-atx.org) is a 501(c)4 volunteer-driven nonprofit organization with a long and rich history advocating around urban issues in Austin. Founded originally as Austinites for Urban Rail Action, AURA has since become the premier grassroots urbanist organization in the region. Beginning with the effort to rewrite the Austin Land Development Code (CodeNEXT) in the 2010s through a focus today on vertical mixed-use development, parking reform and transit oriented development, AURA has been the foundational community group lifting up pro-housing, pro-transit policies. 

[Farm&City](http://www.farmandcity.org) is an independent 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to high quality urban & rural human habitat in Texas in perpetuity. We work at the intersections of transportation, urban planning, sustainability, and equity to improve Texas public policy at the city, county, metropolitan, and state levels. Some of our major accomplishments include TxDOT’s paradigm shift to a system safety approach and the similar shift happening at cities, counties, and MPOs across the state, significant land use reforms at the City of Austin, and the 2020 transit and multimodal funding votes in Austin.
